Future Work, Limitations & Acknowledgment

Future improvements
• Collect labeled feedback to compute precision/recall/NDCG and train a hybrid model.
• Add semantic embeddings (SBERT) with vector search for deeper matches.
• Personalization from implicit feedback with session‑based re‑ranking.
• Incremental caching and async image fetch for scale.

Limitations
• No ground‑truth labels; outcomes depend on metadata quality.
• Cold‑start uses popularity defaults; privacy limits tracking.

Acknowledgment
Thanks to mentors, peers, and the open‑source stack—Streamlit, pandas, RapidFuzz, NumPy, Pillow, and XlsxWriter—for enabling this build.

Thank You & Q/A
Happy to discuss features (fuzzy matching, sliders, caching, visuals, uploads/exports) and next steps. Q/A welcome.
